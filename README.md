- âš¡ Fun fact: At the age of 7, playing outside of my Father's cousin's apartment in Madrid, Spain, I wandered off after hearing a flock of sheep just over the hill.  For the next hour I followed the flock until I arrived at the home of the shepherd.  When my mother found me, she was a little ticked off at me.
